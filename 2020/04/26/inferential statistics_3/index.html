Introduction</h2><p>Statistical hypothesis testing assumes that hypothesis that is testable on the basis of observing a process that is modeled via a set of random variables. Commonly, two statistical data sets are compared. Two hypotheses will be involved in the testing which are <strong>null hypothesis</strong> and <strong>alternative hypothesis</strong>. It will be determined by threshold for the statistical probability whether the null hypothesis will be rejected and to accept the alternative hypothesis.</p>
<p>Four classical hypothesis testing will be introduced which are <strong>T test, Z test, F test and Chi-square test</strong>.</p>

Why we need hypothesis testing – problems solved by hypothesis testing"></a>3. Why we need hypothesis testing – problems solved by hypothesis testing</h2><p>In the real world, we want to evaluate but it is very hard to get all the data for the general population. But we could collect and utilize samples from this population to infer the general population. </p>
<p>For example, we have two versions for an APP and we want to know that which version will have higher conversion rate. We could conduct an A/B testing experiment to collect sample from APP for a period of time. From this experiment result generates from these sample, we know version A have the better performance. Based on the hypothesis testing, we could assume that the conversion rate for this APP will show the same result which is version A have the better conversion rate than version B in the future of APP deployment.</p>
<h2 id="4-The-process-of-hypothesis-testing"><a href="#4-The-process-of-hypothesis-testing" class="headerlink" title="4. The process of hypothesis testing"></a>4. The process of hypothesis testing</h2><p>•    State null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis.</p>
<p>•    Specify which α level (significance level) according to the equation setting for null and alternative hypothesis. Usually which between 1% and 5%.</p>
<p>•    Collect sample data.</p>
<p>•    Compute the P-value based on α level.</p>
<p>•    Draw a conclusion about H0 based on P value.</p>

What you should know about the hypothesis testing</h2><h4 id="Null-hypothesis-and-alternative-hypothesis"><a href="#Null-hypothesis-and-alternative-hypothesis" class="headerlink" title="Null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis"></a><strong><em>Null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis</em></strong></h4><p>For the hypothesis testing, there will have two type hypothesis which are null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis. </p>
<p>Usually, we want to get the P value lowers than the significant level or α level to reject the Null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis.</p>
<p>The equation setting for the <strong>Null hypothesis</strong> usually will be =, &gt;=, &lt;=.<br>The equation setting for the <strong>Alternative hypothesis</strong> usually will be !=, &lt;=, &gt;=.</p>
<h4 id="Single-and-two-population-hypothesis-testing"><a href="#Single-and-two-population-hypothesis-testing" class="headerlink" title="Single and two population hypothesis testing"></a><strong><em>Single and two population hypothesis testing</em></strong></h4><p>For the hypothesis testing, we want to figure out the problems by using data for one population or two different population. For example, we want to figure out the conversion rate for an App in two period and we did not separate the users into different group. The population for this experiment is single hypothesis testing. Another example for two population hypothesis testing is that we separate user into two group for different version of App and conduct testing to figure out whether the mean value for these two group is significant different.</p>

<p>•    No outlier in the sample data.</p>
<p>•    Close to normal distribution.</p>
<p>But two sample t test requires variances of the two distributions are the same which is quoted as homogeneity of variance or homoscedasticity.</p>

<p><strong>Confidence level</strong>: The probability that if a poll/test/survey were repeated over and over again, the results obtained would be the same. A confidence level =  1 - alpha. </p>
<p>  <img src="/images/inferential_statistics_3ht/4-3.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Confidence interval</strong>: A range of results from a poll, experiment, or survey that would be expected to contain the population parameter of interest. For example, an average response. Confidence intervals are constructed using significance levels / confidence levels. </p>

You could apply T-test to infer from sample data to the general population since it is difficult to collect the data from the population.</p>
<h4 id="Definition"><a href="#Definition" class="headerlink" title="Definition"></a><strong><em>Definition</em></strong></h4><p>T-test is a statistical hypothesis test in which test statistic follow student’s t-distribution under the null hypothesis. The t-test can be used to determine if the means of two sets of data are significant different from each other.</p>
<h4 id="Assumptions"><a href="#Assumptions" class="headerlink" title="Assumptions"></a><strong><em>Assumptions</em></strong></h4><p>•    The means of the two populations being compared should follow normal distributions. </p>
<p>•    The two populations being compared should have the same variance. </p>
<p>•    The data used to carry out the test should either be sampled independently from the two populations being compared or be fully paired.</p>
<h4 id="Distribution"><a href="#Distribution" class="headerlink" title="Distribution"></a><strong><em>Distribution</em></strong></h4><p>The distribution for t-test is t distribution. t-distribution is a member of continuous probability distributions family that arises when estimating the mean of a normally distributed population in situations where the sample size is small with degree of freedom and the population standard deviation is unknown.</p>
<p>For t-test, the T-distribution is to assess the statistical significance of the difference between two sample mean. And t-distribution also arises from Bayesian analysis of data from a normal family.</p>

<p><strong>Alternative hypothesis</strong> usually will be Group A != Group B, Group A &lt;= Group B, Group A &gt;= Group B.</p>
<h4 id="Examples"><a href="#Examples" class="headerlink" title="Examples"></a><strong><em>Examples</em></strong></h4><p><strong>One-sample t-test</strong>:</p>
<p>Your company wants to improve sales. Past sales data indicate that the average sale was 100 dollar per transaction. After training your sales force, recent sales data (taken from a sample of 25 salesmen) indicates an average sale of 130 dollar, with a standard deviation of 15 dollar. Did the training work?</p>
<p>𝐻0: The training not works.<br>𝐻𝑎: The training works.</p>
<p>We could see from the example that the sample (25 salesmen) come from a population(all salesmen in the company).</p>
<p><strong>Two-sample t-test</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>independent samples</li>
</ol>
<p>Has the quality of life improved for patients who took drug A as opposed to patients who took drug B? (patients for drug A and B are randomly selected and with the same/different size and the variance are equal/unequal for these two group) </p>
<p>𝐻0: Drug B did not improve the quality of life compare with A.<br>𝐻𝑎: Drug B did improve the quality of life compare with A.</p>
<p>Group A and Group B are independent.</p>

<h3 id="Z-Test"><a href="#Z-Test" class="headerlink" title="Z Test"></a>Z Test</h3><h4 id="Why-we-need-Z-test"><a href="#Why-we-need-Z-test" class="headerlink" title="Why we need Z-test?"></a><strong><em>Why we need Z-test?</em></strong></h4><p>Z-test is formed from T-test. It would apply when the test statistics would follow a standard normal distribution. Unlike T-test, the Z-test calculate when the deviation for the population has already known.</p>
<h4 id="Definition-1"><a href="#Definition-1" class="headerlink" title="Definition"></a><strong><em>Definition</em></strong></h4><p>A Z-test is any statistical test for which the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis can be approximated by a normal distribution. </p>
<h4 id="Assumptions-1"><a href="#Assumptions-1" class="headerlink" title="Assumptions"></a><strong><em>Assumptions</em></strong></h4><p>•    Distributions of the two populations are normal. </p>
<p>•    The variances of the two distributions are known and are the same.</p>
<p>•    we already know the population variance σ (Because of the central limit theorem, many test statistics are approximately normally distributed for large samples).</p>
<p>•    sample data larger than 30.</p>
<h4 id="Distribution-1"><a href="#Distribution-1" class="headerlink" title="Distribution"></a><strong><em>Distribution</em></strong></h4><p>Z-distribution (standard normal distribution) The standard normal distribution is centered at zero and the degree to which a given measurement deviates from the mean is given by the standard deviation.</p>
<p> <img src="/images/inferential_statistics_3ht/Z-1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You could learn more details about Z-distribution from my another post <a href="http://www.yilinhuang.cool/2020/04/05/inferential%20statistics_distribution/#4-3-Z-distribution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statistical distribution</a>. </p>
<h4 id="Type"><a href="#Type" class="headerlink" title="Type"></a><strong><em>Type</em></strong></h4><p>The term “Z-test” is often used to refer specifically to the <strong>one-sample</strong> location test comparing the mean of a set of measurements to a given constant when the sample variance is known.</p>
<h4 id="Hypotheses-1"><a href="#Hypotheses-1" class="headerlink" title="Hypotheses"></a><strong><em>Hypotheses</em></strong></h4><p>The hypotheses depend on the assumption that you want to test for this experiment.</p>
<p><strong>Null hypothesis</strong> usually will be Group A = Group B, Group A &gt;= Group B, Group A &lt;= Group B.</p>
<p><strong>Alternative hypothesis</strong> usually will be Group A != Group B, Group A &lt;= Group B, Group A &gt;= Group B.</p>
<h4 id="Example"><a href="#Example" class="headerlink" title="Example"></a><strong><em>Example</em></strong></h4><p>Twenty five high school students complete a preparation program for taking the SAT test.  Here are the SAT scores from the 25 students who completed the SAT prep program:</p>
<p>434 694 457 534 720 400 484 478 610 641 425 636 454<br>514 563 370 499 640 501 625 612 471 598 509 531</p>
<p>The mean of these scores is 536.00.  We know that the population average for SAT scores is 500 with a standard deviation of 100.</p>
<p>The question is, are these students’ SAT scores (M = 536) significantly greater than a population mean of 500 with a population standard deviation of 100?</p>
<p>𝐻0: These students’ SAT scores are different with the population with mean of 500.<br>𝐻𝑎: These students’ SAT scores are no different with the population with mean of 500.</p>
<h3 id="Chi-square-Test"><a href="#Chi-square-Test" class="headerlink" title="Chi-square Test"></a>Chi-square Test</h3><h4 id="Why-we-need-Chi-square-test"><a href="#Why-we-need-Chi-square-test" class="headerlink" title="Why we need Chi-square test?"></a><strong><em>Why we need Chi-square test?</em></strong></h4><p>Unlike T-test and Z-test for continuous data, Chi-square applys to the <strong>categorical data</strong> to test whether there is statistically significant difference between the variance for the observed frequencies and expected frequencies. </p>
<h4 id="Definition-2"><a href="#Definition-2" class="headerlink" title="Definition"></a><strong><em>Definition</em></strong></h4><p>Chi-square test is a statistical hypothesis test that is valid to perform when the test statistic is chi-squared distributed under the null hypothesis. It is used to determine whether there is a statistical difference between the <strong>expected frequencies</strong> and the <strong>observed frequencies</strong> in on or more categories of a so-called contingency table.</p>
<h4 id="Assumptions-2"><a href="#Assumptions-2" class="headerlink" title="Assumptions"></a><strong><em>Assumptions</em></strong></h4><p>•    The observations are independent and normally distributed.</p>
<h4 id="Distribution-2"><a href="#Distribution-2" class="headerlink" title="Distribution"></a><strong><em>Distribution</em></strong></h4><p>The chi-square distribution is used in the common chi-square tests for goodness of fit of an observed distribution to a theoretical one; The independence of two criteria of classification of qualitative data; And in confidence interval estimation for a population standard deviation of a normal distribution from a sample standard deviation.</p>

<h4 id="Hypotheses-2"><a href="#Hypotheses-2" class="headerlink" title="Hypotheses"></a><strong><em>Hypotheses</em></strong></h4><p><strong>Null hypothesis</strong> assumes that Variable A and Variable B are independent.</p>
<p><strong>Alternative hypothesis</strong> assumes that Variable A and Variable B are not independent.</p>
<h4 id="Types-1"><a href="#Types-1" class="headerlink" title="Types"></a><strong><em>Types</em></strong></h4><p>Chi-square test likes T-test has one sample test and two sample test. And for two sample test includes independent sample and paired sample. If the variable has more than 2 classification, we need to apply different method in two-sample chi-square test.</p>

<h4 id="Examples-1"><a href="#Examples-1" class="headerlink" title="Examples"></a><strong><em>Examples</em></strong></h4><p><strong>One-sample</strong>:</p>
<p>Suppose we wish to determine if an ordinary-looking six-sided die is fair, or balanced, meaning that every face has probability 1/6 of landing on top when the die is tossed. We could toss the die dozens, maybe hundreds, of times and compare the actual number of times each face landed on top to the expected number, which would be 1/6 of the total number of tosses. We wouldn’t expect each number to be exactly 1/6 of the total, but it should be close.</p>
<p>𝐻0: The die is fair.<br>𝐻𝑎: The die is not fair.</p>

<h3 id="F-Test"><a href="#F-Test" class="headerlink" title="F-Test"></a>F-Test</h3><h4 id="Why-we-need-F-test"><a href="#Why-we-need-F-test" class="headerlink" title="Why we need F-test?"></a><strong><em>Why we need F-test?</em></strong></h4><p>Unlike T and Z test only for 2 samples, F-test could apply to multiple groups of data (2 or more than 2 groups). F-test is usually applied to check that whether there is statistically significant difference between this group by their variance.</p>
<h4 id="Definition-3"><a href="#Definition-3" class="headerlink" title="Definition"></a><strong><em>Definition</em></strong></h4><p>An F-test is conducted by the researcher on the basis of the F statistic. The F statistic is defined as the ratio between the two independent chi square variates that are divided by their respective degree of freedom.</p>
<p>The F-test is designed to test if multiple population variances are equal to identify whether these populations are come from the same population. It does this by comparing the ratio of multiple variances. So, if the variances are equal, the ratio of the variances will be 1. Another application of Exact “F-tests” mainly arise when the models have been fitted to the data using least squares for linear regression.</p>
<h4 id="Assumptions-3"><a href="#Assumptions-3" class="headerlink" title="Assumptions"></a><strong><em>Assumptions</em></strong></h4><p>•    The populations from which the samples were obtained must be normal.</p>
<p>•    The samples must be independent</p>
<h4 id="Distribution-3"><a href="#Distribution-3" class="headerlink" title="Distribution"></a><strong><em>Distribution</em></strong></h4><p>In probability theory and statistics, the F-distribution, also known as Snedecor’s F distribution or the Fisher–Snedecor distribution (after Ronald Fisher and George W. Snedecor) is a continuous probability distribution that arises frequently as the null distribution of a test statistic, most notably in the analysis of variance (ANOVA), or F test.</p>

<h4 id="Hypotheses-3"><a href="#Hypotheses-3" class="headerlink" title="Hypotheses"></a><strong><em>Hypotheses</em></strong></h4><p><strong>Null hypothesis</strong> assumes that no difference in variances.</p>
<p><strong>Alternative hypothesis</strong> assumes that there is difference in variances.</p>
<h4 id="Types-2"><a href="#Types-2" class="headerlink" title="Types"></a><strong><em>Types</em></strong></h4><p>Base on two different types of main application, there are two formula for F statistics.</p>
<p><img src="/images/inferential_statistics_3ht/F-2.png" alt=""> </p>

<ol>
<li>Multiple-comparison ANOVA problem: </li>
</ol>
<p>The F-test in one-way analysis of variance is used to assess whether the expected values of a quantitative variable within several pre-defined groups differ from each other. For example, suppose that a medical trial compares four treatments. The ANOVA F-test can be used to assess whether any of the treatments is on average superior, or inferior, to the others versus the null hypothesis that all four treatments yield the same mean response. </p>
<p><strong>The advantage</strong> of the ANOVA F-test is that we do not need to pre-specify which treatments are to be compared, and we do not need to adjust for making multiple comparisons. </p>
<p><strong>The disadvantage</strong> of the ANOVA F-test is that if we reject the null hypothesis, we do not know which treatments can be said to be significantly different from the others, nor, if the F-test is performed at level α, can we state that the treatment pair with the greatest mean difference is significantly different at level α.</p>

<p>The F-test for linear regression tests whether any of the independent variables in a multiple linear regression model are significant.</p>
<p>H0:   β1 = β2 = … = βp-1 = 0 (which means that that the model with no independent variables fits the data as well as your model.)</p>
<p>Ha:   βj ≠ 0, for at least one value of j (which means that your model fits the data better than the intercept-only model.)</p>

<h2 id="8-Summary"><a href="#8-Summary" class="headerlink" title="8. Summary"></a>8. Summary</h2><p>Hope this post will help you get a clue about hypothesis testing. Basically the hypothesis testing is to infer the conclusion to the general population from the samples based on the statistical assumption. Because it is difficult to collect all the data from the general population. In general, the assumption for the hypotheis testing requires the sample to be independent and normal distribution and then you could do the hypothesis testing. For different hypothesis testing, the purpose and the data type could apply to the hypothesis testing are different. Before you conduct the hypothesis, it is important for you to understand very detail about the problem you want to solve firstly and what types of data you have.</p>
<p>Excep these four classical hypothesis testing which are T-test, Z-test, Chi-square test and F-test, there are also others hypothesis testing to solve different problem. However if you learn these four hypothesis testing well, it will be very easy for to understand others. </p>
